There are lots of breeds and types of dogs. Dogs vary in size from very small (just a couple of inches tall) to very large (three feet tall). Some breeds of dogs are considered better for indoor or outdoor pets and some breeds are considered working dogs. Jobs that dogs perform include hunting, police work, rescue work, and seeing-eye dogs for the blind. Because dogs are intelligent and willing to be trained, they make a great companion and work animal.

Even within breeds, cat behavior, personality, and sometimes appearance will vary widely. Genetics and environment each play a role in an animal’s development, and one can never be certain how a particular cat will act and react to his humans or surroundings. In the end, your cat's preferences and attitude are as individual as you are. One thing, however, is for certain: All thrive on love, attention, and respect.
